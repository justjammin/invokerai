## Communication style (caveman)

**Chat / prose:** Default **caveman ultra** — terse, drop articles where safe, fragments OK, abbreviations (DB/auth/config/req/res/fn), arrows for flow (X → Y). Technical terms + identifiers exact. **Code, commits, PR bodies:** normal professional English (PSR names, clear sentences).

**Break character:** Normal prose for security warnings, irreversible ops, multi-step sequences where fragment order misleads.

**Override:** User says `stop caveman` or `normal mode` → chat prose normal until they ask caveman again.

## Don't

### Structure
- Create interfaces, abstract classes, or factories for things that have one implementation and will never have a second
- Add Repository + Service + Factory layers for queries that fit in three lines
- Apply Strategy or Builder patterns to problems a switch statement or array literal already solves
- Inject dependencies into static utility classes
- Design for hypothetical future requirements — build what was asked

### Naming
- Use `$result`, `$response`, `$data`, `$output` as variable names — name what the thing actually is
- Prefix methods with `handle`, `process`, or `manage` when a specific verb exists
- Name a method `getUserData()` when it formats, not fetches
- Mix `$req` / `$request` or other abbreviation styles in the same file

### Comments
- Comment what the code does — well-named identifiers already do that
- Write `@param string $name The name` — it restates the type hint
- Leave `// TODO: handle edge cases` with no ticket and no context
- Open every function with `// This method...`
- Write multi-line docblocks on private methods under five lines

### Error Handling
- Silently swallow exceptions: `catch (Exception $e) { return null; }`
- Wrap operations in try/catch when they can't throw
- Catch `\Exception` when a specific exception type exists
- Log an error at the catch site and then re-throw it (picks up a double log upstream)
- Wrap every catch in a custom exception type for no reason

### PHP
- Write `if ($thing === true)` — write `if ($thing)`
- Write `count($arr) > 0` — write `!empty($arr)`
- Use `array_push($arr, $val)` — use `$arr[] = $val`
- Add explicit `return null;` at the end of void functions
- Guard every array key with `isset()` when the key is guaranteed
- Cast a value to a type it already is
- Use `sprintf('%s', $var)` for single-variable interpolation
- Write fully qualified class names in docblocks when a `use` statement exists

### JavaScript / TypeScript
- Reach for `any` when types get complicated — figure out the type
- Leave unused imports in
- Wrap a function reference: `() => doThing()` instead of `doThing`
- Optional-chain values that are guaranteed to exist
- Leave `console.log` statements in committed code
- Wrap synchronous code in `Promise.resolve().then()`

### Logic
- Write `if (condition) { return true; } else { return false; }` — return the condition
- Add `else` after a block that already returns
- Double-negate: `!($x !== $y)`
- Write a ternary where both branches are the same value
- Call `array_merge` inside a loop — build the array first, merge once

### Testing
- Name tests `testItShouldDoTheThingWhenConditionIsMet` — name the behavior
- Test private method calls instead of observable behavior
- Write a `setUp()` longer than the test it serves
- Mock pure functions and simple value objects
- Enforce one assertion per test when three assertions describe a single behavior

### API Design
- Map endpoints 1:1 to database columns — model the domain, not the schema
- Wrap every response in `{ success: true, data: {...}, message: "OK" }`
- Use verbs in endpoint names: `POST /createUser` → `POST /users`
- Hardcode `totalPages: 1` in paginated responses
- Return HTTP 200 with an error object in the body

### Documentation
- Write READMEs that describe what the project is but not how to run it
- Draw architecture diagrams that only show the happy path
- Paste code examples that don't work if you copy them
- Write changelog entries like "Fixed various bugs and improved performance"

## LENA Tool Protocol

**Prefer lean-ctx MCP tools:**
- `ctx_read` > `Read` / `cat` / `head` / `tail`
- `ctx_shell` > `Bash` / `Shell`
- `ctx_search` > `Grep` / `rg`
- `ctx_tree` > `ls` / `find`
- Native `Edit` / `Write` unchanged; use `ctx_edit` only if `Edit` requires a prior `Read` that failed

**Task tracking (bd / Beads):**
- On start: `bd update <id> --claim --json`
- On done: `bd close <id> --reason "<summary>" --json`
- bd unavailable → skip silently, proceed

**Architecture analysis:** use `graphify` for relationship/impact analysis
