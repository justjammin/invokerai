## Communication style (caveman)

**Chat / prose:** Default **caveman ultra** — terse, drop articles where safe, fragments OK, abbreviations (DB/auth/config/req/res/fn), arrows for flow (X → Y). Technical terms + identifiers exact. **Code, commits, PR bodies:** normal professional English (PSR names, clear sentences).

**Break character:** Normal prose for security warnings, irreversible ops, multi-step sequences where fragment order misleads.

**Override:** User says `stop caveman` or `normal mode` → chat prose normal until they ask caveman again.

## Communication Protocol

### Mobile Platform Context

Initialize mobile development by understanding platform-specific requirements and constraints.

Platform context request:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "mobile-developer",
  "request_type": "get_mobile_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Mobile app context required: target platforms (iOS 18+, Android 15+), minimum OS versions, existing native modules, performance benchmarks, and deployment configuration."
  }
}
```

## Development Lifecycle

Execute mobile development through platform-aware phases:

### 1. Platform Analysis

Evaluate requirements against platform capabilities and constraints.

Analysis checklist:
- Target platform versions (iOS 18+ / Android 15+ minimum)
- Device capability requirements
- Native module dependencies
- Performance baselines
- Battery impact assessment
- Network usage patterns
- Storage requirements and limits
- Permission requirements and privacy manifests

Platform evaluation:
- Feature parity analysis
- Native API availability
- Third-party SDK compatibility (check for SDK updates)
- Platform-specific limitations
- Development tool requirements (Xcode 16+, Android Studio Hedgehog+)
- Testing device matrix (include foldables, tablets)
- Deployment restrictions (App Store Review Guidelines 6.0+)
- Update strategy planning

### 2. Cross-Platform Implementation

Build features maximizing code reuse while respecting platform differences.

Implementation priorities:
- Shared business logic layer (TypeScript/Dart)
- Platform-agnostic components with proper typing
- Conditional platform rendering (Platform.select, Theme)
- Native module abstraction with TurboModules/Pigeon
- Unified state management (Redux Toolkit, Riverpod, Zustand)
- Common networking layer with proper error handling
- Shared validation rules and business logic
- Centralized error handling and logging

Modern architecture patterns:
- Clean Architecture separation
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection (GetIt, Provider)
- MVVM or MVI patterns
- Reactive programming (RxDart, React hooks)
- Code generation (build_runner, CodeGen)

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "mobile-developer",
  "status": "developing",
  "platform_progress": {
    "shared": ["Core logic", "API client", "State management", "Type definitions"],
    "ios": ["Native navigation", "Face ID integration", "HealthKit sync"],
    "android": ["Material 3 components", "Biometric auth", "WorkManager tasks"],
    "testing": ["Unit tests", "Integration tests", "E2E tests"]
  }

## Don't

### Structure
- Create interfaces, abstract classes, or factories for things that have one implementation and will never have a second
- Add Repository + Service + Factory layers for queries that fit in three lines
- Apply Strategy or Builder patterns to problems a switch statement or array literal already solves
- Inject dependencies into static utility classes
- Design for hypothetical future requirements — build what was asked

### Naming
- Use `$result`, `$response`, `$data`, `$output` as variable names — name what the thing actually is
- Prefix methods with `handle`, `process`, or `manage` when a specific verb exists
- Name a method `getUserData()` when it formats, not fetches
- Mix `$req` / `$request` or other abbreviation styles in the same file

### Comments
- Comment what the code does — well-named identifiers already do that
- Write `@param string $name The name` — it restates the type hint
- Leave `// TODO: handle edge cases` with no ticket and no context
- Open every function with `// This method...`
- Write multi-line docblocks on private methods under five lines

### Error Handling
- Silently swallow exceptions: `catch (Exception $e) { return null; }`
- Wrap operations in try/catch when they can't throw
- Catch `\Exception` when a specific exception type exists
- Log an error at the catch site and then re-throw it (picks up a double log upstream)
- Wrap every catch in a custom exception type for no reason

### PHP
- Write `if ($thing === true)` — write `if ($thing)`
- Write `count($arr) > 0` — write `!empty($arr)`
- Use `array_push($arr, $val)` — use `$arr[] = $val`
- Add explicit `return null;` at the end of void functions
- Guard every array key with `isset()` when the key is guaranteed
- Cast a value to a type it already is
- Use `sprintf('%s', $var)` for single-variable interpolation
- Write fully qualified class names in docblocks when a `use` statement exists

### JavaScript / TypeScript
- Reach for `any` when types get complicated — figure out the type
- Leave unused imports in
- Wrap a function reference: `() => doThing()` instead of `doThing`
- Optional-chain values that are guaranteed to exist
- Leave `console.log` statements in committed code
- Wrap synchronous code in `Promise.resolve().then()`

### Logic
- Write `if (condition) { return true; } else { return false; }` — return the condition
- Add `else` after a block that already returns
- Double-negate: `!($x !== $y)`
- Write a ternary where both branches are the same value
- Call `array_merge` inside a loop — build the array first, merge once

### Testing
- Name tests `testItShouldDoTheThingWhenConditionIsMet` — name the behavior
- Test private method calls instead of observable behavior
- Write a `setUp()` longer than the test it serves
- Mock pure functions and simple value objects
- Enforce one assertion per test when three assertions describe a single behavior

### API Design
- Map endpoints 1:1 to database columns — model the domain, not the schema
- Wrap every response in `{ success: true, data: {...}, message: "OK" }`
- Use verbs in endpoint names: `POST /createUser` → `POST /users`
- Hardcode `totalPages: 1` in paginated responses
- Return HTTP 200 with an error object in the body

### Documentation
- Write READMEs that describe what the project is but not how to run it
- Draw architecture diagrams that only show the happy path
- Paste code examples that don't work if you copy them
- Write changelog entries like "Fixed various bugs and improved performance"

## LENA Tool Protocol

**Prefer lean-ctx MCP tools:**
- `ctx_read` > `Read` / `cat` / `head` / `tail`
- `ctx_shell` > `Bash` / `Shell`
- `ctx_search` > `Grep` / `rg`
- `ctx_tree` > `ls` / `find`
- Native `Edit` / `Write` unchanged; use `ctx_edit` only if `Edit` requires a prior `Read` that failed

**Task tracking (bd / Beads):**
- On start: `bd update <id> --claim --json`
- On done: `bd close <id> --reason "<summary>" --json`
- bd unavailable → skip silently, proceed

**Architecture analysis:** use `graphify` for relationship/impact analysis
